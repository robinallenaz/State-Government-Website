Introduction
Front-end web designers must know how to create user interfaces that are both visually attractive and functional. In this task, you will act as a front-end web designer to create two low-level comprehensive page layouts: one to be used as a home page for a multipage website, which you will create in Task 2, and one to be used for the interior pages of that website.
Scenario
You are at a job interview for an entry-level position on the web development team at a state government office. After inquiring about your education, skills, and experience, the hiring manager asks you to design some low-level comprehensive page layouts as part of the interview process.

The website will feature information about one U.S. state and three cities within that state. The first layout will serve as the template for the site's home page. This page will include some introductory information about the state, some images, and links to three interior pages. The second layout will serve as the model for the interior pages of the site. Each of these interior pages will feature one city within the chosen state. Each of these three pages will also include information about the city, such as demographics, population, average salary, cost of living, and weather, as well as images.
Assumptions
Before you begin, consider the following:

•   This task does not involve coding with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Instead, you will create images of two low-level comprehensive page layouts and submit them for evaluation. You can use any graphics creation or manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or other appropriate tool of your choice to create the images.

•   After submitting this task, you may contact your assigned instructor for guidance on how to make any needed revisions. You should aim to pass your task within three attempts.

 

Note: This task must be completed, submitted, and evaluated as a "Pass" before you can submit Task 2. You should not begin working on Task 2 until this task has been evaluated as a "Pass."

Requirements
Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.  

Grammarly Note: 
Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.  

Microsoft Files Note: 
Write your paper in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) unless another Microsoft product, or pdf, is specified in the task directions. Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc.  All supporting documentation, such as screenshots and proof of experience, should be collected in a pdf file and submitted separately from the main file. For more information, please see Computer System and Technology Requirements.  

 

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.

 

A.  Use your chosen graphics software to create one image of each of the following low-level comprehensive layouts (a total of two images):

1.  Create Layout #1, a home page including clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements:

•   a header element

•   a nav  element

•   a section element

•   an aside element

 

Note: This layout will be used in Task 2 to create the main entry point into the website.

 

2.  Create Layout #2, an interior page including clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements:

•   a header element

•   a nav  element

•   a section element

•   an aside element

 

Note: This layout will be used in Task 2 to create all other pages of the website that are not the home page.

 

Note: Save the two images to a location on your computer that you can easily access later.

Introduction
Front-end web developers must know how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make interfaces work in an online environment. In Task 1, you acted as a web designer to create two low-level comprehensive page layouts. In this task, you will use your newly acquired web development skills to create a multipage website. You will use the same two low-level comprehensive page layouts you created in Task 1 as templates for the pages in this task.

Note: Because your site will be live, use caution with the content and images you include on your website. The public will have access to your website, so do not include any sensitive or private information.

Note: All the code in your submission must be your own original work. You may not use premade templates of any sort, including the templates provided in the exercise files of the course, blog software such as Blogger and WordPress, content management systems like Joomla! and PHP-Nuke, GUI web design software like Adobe Dreamweaver, or any type of WYSIWYG application that produces code by clicking a button.
Scenario
Congratulations! You got the job! You just finished your first week at the state government office where you completed the orientation and onboarding documentation. You have also met with your new supervisor daily to learn more about the department and expectations of your role, as well as your new colleagues who have been teaching you about the systems used in the office. You are now ready to develop the new website for the state government office.
Assumptions
Before you begin this task, remember that you should not begin working on Task 2 until Task 1 has been evaluated as a "Pass," as you will be building upon your work submitted in Task 1. Task 1 must be completed, submitted, and evaluated as a "Pass" before you submit this task. If your work on this task is not evaluated as a "Pass," you should contact your assigned instructor for guidance on how to make any necessary revisions.

 

As you begin, keep in mind that this task involves coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use the code editor of your choice to complete the task, but more advanced editors may be overkill. Plain text editors, such as Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, or Brackets, will work well.
